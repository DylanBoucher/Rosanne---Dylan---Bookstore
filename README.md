User Stories:

    This websiteâ€™s purpose is to allow users to buy and sell used books.  

    Users with no login will only have access to index pages and show pages.  

    Users who log in will be able to access index and show pages, as well as add books to be sold, purchase books, edit books to be sold, add  reviews, and edit their user profile.

    All users will start at the main page where they can see the index, access show pages, and user logins.
